Compared to existing works, our DisCo achieves:

1. Generalizability to a large-scale real-world human without human-specific fine-tuning (we also support human-specific fine-tuning if you want). Previous methods only support generation for a specific domain of human, e.g., DreamPose only generate fashion model with easy catwalk pose.

2. Current SOTA results for referring human dance generation.

3. Extensive usage cases and applications (see project page for more details).

4. An easy-to-follow framework, supporting efficient training (x-formers, FP16 training, deepspeed, wandb) and a wide range of possible research directions (pre-training -> fine-tuning -> human-specific fine-tuning).
